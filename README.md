### Deployment / Hosting

This project is divided into three main parts: the front-end, back-end (API), and the database. Each part is hosted on different services:

- **Front-end**:
  - **Hosting**: Vercel
  - **Description**: The front-end of the application, which is a React/Next.js app, is hosted on Vercel. Vercel is responsible for continuous deployment of the front-end, automatically generating new versions from the main branch.

- **Back-end (API)**:
  - **Hosting**: Back4App
  - **Description**: The API for this project is hosted on Back4App, which provides support for the Node.js back-end and integrations with database services.

- **Database**:
